#This subfolder is intended minor cases where a handful of minor names need to be replaced, but complete overhauling of localised naming is not intended or desirable.

#This is the case primarily when two cultures in the same group contested a province and had a different name for it (example Astoria vs. Fort George between Americans and British), or when a OPM wants a different 
#name for its capital (example Andria renames Barletta to Andria when owned by Andria tag), or when any large quantity of localised naming isn't realistically/practically feasible (Highland Scottish, for example, will never
#probably receive naming outside of Scotland. Irish will be fine elsewhere)

#All major overhauls should still go in the primary folder.
