#Moving forming decisions to BtPLReplaceVanillaCountryFormations

#I normally don't like messing with vanilla files when I don't have to, but between all the map changes and the fact that I wanted to clean up a few things
#and make everything more dynamic anyway, I figured I'd just reorganise. Hope this doesn't mess with anyone too much. - Draiocht
