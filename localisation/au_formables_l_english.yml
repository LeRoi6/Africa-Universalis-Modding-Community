 great_zimbabwe_nation_desc:0 "The once great center of Great Zimbabwe has fallen into ruin and now has become a husk of a city. We still remember the glory of this city, and by controlling the new trade centers that have popped up and the gold mines in the region, we can revive this empire and restore it to its new glory."
