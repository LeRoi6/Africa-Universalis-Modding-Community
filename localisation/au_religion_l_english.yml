mhondoro_religion_desc:1 "Mhondoro are spirit ancestors. Whether from a local family dynasty, they wander across the land, inhabiting maneless lions. Once they have found a host, they live in their bodies, becoming an oracle. People go to consult them, and the svikiro consumes 'bute' (snuff) to connect with the Mhondoro. The Mhondoro is usually responsible for their tribe or family, and many deal with the rain. One of the most iconic mhondoros is Mwari, who resides in the shrine of Great Zimbabwe."
