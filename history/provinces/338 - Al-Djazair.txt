#Handy Wiki quote for reference and reinforcement -
#As early as 1302 the islet of Peñón in front of Algiers harbour had been occupied by Spaniards. Thereafter, a considerable amount of trade began to flow between Algiers and Spain. However, Algiers 
#continued to be of comparatively little importance until after the expulsion of the Moors from Spain, many of whom sought asylum in the city.
#Only wiki, but it is so convenient to copy-paste and this appears to be correct.
