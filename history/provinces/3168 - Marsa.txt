culture = greek			#uncertain, but appears a large Greek presence continued here for a little while after Ottoman conquest. It is right in Byzantine-Bulgarian contested territory. Niki changes to Bulgarian because there is no evidence of Greeks here, but Draiocht changed it back again. Uzundzhovo fair appears to be a calque from Greek, and we likewise have no evidence it was Bulgarian already. Unlike everything N and W, Bulgarian since at least 900, this area didn't go to Bulgaria until mid 1200s, only 1 or 2 gens before our start.
